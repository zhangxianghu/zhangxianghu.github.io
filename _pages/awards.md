I am Ph.D. student at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/) in the [Center for Cyber Security and Privacy](https://ccsp.uoregon.edu/) group, where I am advised by [Dr. Christopher Wilson](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~cwilson/) and [Dr. Jun Li](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~lijun/). 
My research interests include cryptography, IoT security and privacy, and blockchain privacy. 
Before joining UO, I received my Masterâ€™s degrees from [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Mike Rosulek](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/). 
My Master's thesis is "Random access machine in secure multi-party computation", with focuses on Oblivious RAM and Zero-knowledge proof. I got my B.E. degree from [North China University of Technology](http://en.ncut.edu.cn/). 

One of my current ongoing projects is designing lightweight and efficient key exchange protocols in IoT environment. 
Another ongoing project is about the privacy in decentralized exchanges with Automated Market Maker Protocols.
